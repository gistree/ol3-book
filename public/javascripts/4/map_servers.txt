If you ever need to serve your own tiles or raster data, you can take a look
at the following open source software:

Geoserver: http://geoserver.org
It is a server software that allows you to serve maps and data from a variety
of formats to standard clients such as web browsers and desktop GIS
programs.

Mapnik: http://www.mapnik.org
It's a toolkit for rendering beautiful maps, with clean, soft feature edges
provided by quality anti-aliasing graphics, intelligent label placement, and
scalable, SVG symbolization. Most popularly, Mapnik is used to render the
OpenStreetMap main map layers.

Mapserver: http://www.mapserver.org
It is an open source geographic data rendering engine written in C. Beyond
browsing GIS data, MapServer allows you to create geographic image maps,
that is, maps that can direct users to web content. Like GeoServer, it allows
map publications via Open Web Standards.

Degree: http://www.deegree.org/
Degree is open source software for spatial data infrastructures and the
geospatial web. It shares with GeoServer and Mapserver the ability to serve
map via Open Web Standards.

We can also mention that there are map proxy applications such as
MapCache http://mapserver.org/mapcache/, GeoWebCache
http://geowebcache.org, or MapProxy http://mapproxy.org.

Their important purposes are creating tiles for dynamic web server, caching
requested map images using GeoServer, MapServer, Mapnik, Degree, or any
other map servers.
